# Custom CSV Reader & Writer

This project implements a custom CSV Reader and CSV Writer in Python, comparing their performance against Python’s built-in `csv` module.

It includes:
- A custom CSV reader written from scratch
- A custom CSV writer written from scratch
- Benchmarks comparing custom vs built-in CSV performance
- Tests on small (10,000 rows) and large (1,000,000 rows) CSV files

The goal is to understand how CSV parsing works internally and measure performance differences between pure Python and optimized CSV libraries.
